# =============================================================================
# Where this is published
# =============================================================================
#
# Two kinds of string, and they are not interchangeable:
#
# *identifiers* -- BASE, VOCAB, DATASET. What a dataset, a distribution, an agent
#   or a minted property *is called*.
# *locations* -- DATASET_DOC_URL, SCHEMA_URL, DOWNLOAD_BASE. Where the bytes are
#   fetched from.
#
# Both kinds resolve against HOST, deliberately: the identifiers have to be
# dereferenceable to be worth minting, and the only server that answers for them is
# the one this repo deploys. ``Caddyfile`` serves ``dcat/`` at the server root and
# negotiates ``/def/`` and ``/id/`` there, which is what makes ``/def/fdb`` return
# the vocabulary rather than a 404.
#
# Hardcoded rather than read from the environment on purpose. ``dcat/`` is
# generated *and committed* -- an environment variable would make the committed
# artefact depend on whoever last ran the generator, and the tests assert the exact
# URIs because a wrong one is not a runtime error, it is a published mistake. A
# change here shows up as a reviewable diff across ``dcat/`` and the tests, which is
# the intended amount of friction for changing an identifier.

# check that every row carries it, and the DCAT metadata's ``dct:license`` and
# ``dcatapde:licenseAttributionByText``.
#
# ND is why nothing in the pipeline rewrites a value: the published table reformats
# the export into columns and resolves its internal links, which is not a derivative
# work of the texts, but editing them would be.
#
# funding_crawler recorded CC BY-ND 3.0 DE and "Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz". Both
# are now out of date -- the imprint says 4.0 and the ministry was renamed -- so

DESCRIPTION_DE = f"""\
Alle Förderprogramme der Förderdatenbank des Bundes (Bund, Länder und EU), ein \
Datensatz pro Programm mit {{fields}} Feldern.

Die Bundesregierung bietet mit der Förderdatenbank eine Suchmaschine für \
Förderungen an, veröffentlicht den zugrundeliegenden Datensatz aber nicht als Open Data im normativen Sinne. \

Grundlage ist der XML-Programmexport der Förderdatenbank.

Der Export beinhaltet immer nur den heutigen Stand. Dieser Datensatz führt daher eine \
Historie: jedes Programm trägt, wann es zuerst erfasst wurde \
(``on_website_from``), wann sich sein Inhalt zuletzt geändert hat \
(``dct:modified``), alle bisherigen Änderungszeitpunkte \
(``previous_update_dates``) und wann es den Export verlassen hat \
(``on_website_to``). Programme, die aus der Förderdatenbank \
verschwinden, bleiben mit ihrem letzten bekannten Inhalt und \
``absent = true`` enthalten. Der Datensatz umfasst damit mehr Programme als \
der Export und wächst über die Zeit.

Diese Historie wird wöchentlich erhoben und als ISO-Kalenderwoche \
(z. B. 2026-W34) angegeben. Ein Lauf kann immer nur feststellen, dass sich \
etwas gegenüber dem vorherigen Lauf geändert hat, also ist die Woche zwischen \
zwei planmäßigen Läufen die tatsächliche Auflösung; ein Zeitstempel würde eine \
Genauigkeit vortäuschen, die die Quelle nicht hergibt. Grundlage sind \
ausschließlich die planmäßigen wöchentlichen Läufe: ein zusätzlicher Lauf \
zwischendurch fließt nicht in die veröffentlichte Historie ein, damit jede \
Angabe dieselbe Bedeutung hat.

Eine Spalte ist modellbasiert und nicht Teil der Quelle: ``keywords_extracted`` \
enthält die Stichwörter, die ein finetuned Sprachmodell aus der \
Rohspalte ``keywords`` herausliest. Upstream sind sie durch Leerzeichen \
verbunden und in {_de(METRICS["no_separator_pct"])} % der Fälle nicht trennbar. \
Jedes Stichwort ist \
nachweislich ein zusammenhängender Abschnitt des Originalstrings, geprüft bei \
jeder Veröffentlichung; die Grenzziehung selbst ist eine Modellentscheidung \
(F1 {_de(METRICS["f1"])} auf einer Handstichprobe). ``keywords`` bleibt unverändert daneben \
stehen. Das Tabellenschema kennzeichnet jede Spalte mit ``fdb:origin`` als \
``upstream``, ``derived`` oder ``inferred``.\

# Manual translation of DESCRIPTION_DE, paragraph for paragraph. Keep in lockstep:
# edit one, edit the other.
DESCRIPTION_EN = f"""\
All funding programmes in the German federal funding database \
(Förderdatenbank; federal, state and EU programmes), one record per programme \
with {{fields}} fields.

The federal government provides the Förderdatenbank as a search engine for \
funding programmes, but does not publish the underlying dataset as Open Data in \
the normative sense.

The basis is the Förderdatenbank's XML programme export.

The export only ever contains today's state. This dataset therefore maintains \
a history: each programme carries when it was first recorded \
(``on_website_from``), when its content last changed (``dct:modified``), \
all previous change timestamps (``previous_update_dates``) and when it left \
the export (``on_website_to``). Programmes that disappear from the \
Förderdatenbank are retained with their last known content and \
``absent = true``. The dataset thus covers more programmes than the \
export and grows over time.

This history is observed weekly and stated as an ISO week (e.g. 2026-W34). A \
run can only ever establish that something differs from the run before it, so \
the week between two scheduled runs is the resolution actually observed; a \
timestamp would claim a precision the source does not support. Only the \
scheduled weekly runs are used: an extra run in between does not enter the \
published history, so that every value carries the same meaning.

One column is model-produced and not part of the source: ``keywords_extracted`` \
holds the keywords a finetuned language model reads out of the raw ``keywords`` \
column. Upstream they are joined with spaces and carry no separator at all in \
{METRICS["no_separator_pct"]}% of cases. Every keyword is verifiably a \
contiguous span of the original string, checked on every publish; where the \
boundaries fall is the model's judgement (F1 {METRICS["f1"]} on a hand-labelled \
sample). ``keywords`` is published unchanged beside it. The table schema marks \
every column with ``fdb:origin`` as ``upstream``, ``derived`` or ``inferred``.\

# --- Columns the export ships pivoted ----------------------------------------
# Two taxonomies arrive spread across one column per parent value, because the

#
# The parent has to travel in the value, in both cases for the same reason: the
# child vocabulary is shared between parents, so a bare child code cannot be
# attributed back.
#
# funding_subarea (19 -> 1)
#     The second Förderbereich level. 91% of programmes carry one, but no single
#     source column exceeds 18% fill, so as 19 columns it was 28% of the table's
#     width and 43597 empty cells in a CSV. 11 sub-area codes occur under more
#     than one parent -- "beratung_schulung" under five -- and 56% of programmes
#     list several Förderbereiche, so dropping the parent would collapse 349 of
#     5963 values.
#
# applicant_sector (2 -> 1)
#     The applicant's economic sector. The two source columns carry the
#     byte-identical eight-sector list and differ only in which applicant type it
#     describes, so their names encode a value of another vocabulary
#     (foerderberechtigte) exactly as the uf_* names encode a Förderbereich. The
#     distinction is real data, not redundancy: "Niederlassung von Ärztinnen und
#     Ärzten" is freie_berufe for a founder and dienstleistungen for an existing
#     business, and InvestEU lists all eight sectors for founders against one for
#     companies. 15 of the 206 programmes that fill both differ that way.
