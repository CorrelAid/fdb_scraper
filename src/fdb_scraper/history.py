"""Land each export run in a database, keeping the history of what changed.

:mod:`fdb_scraper.pipeline` answers "what does the export say today". This module
answers "what did it say last month, and when did this programme appear" -- which
the export cannot, because it only ever ships the current state.

Two tables, both loaded with dlt's ``scd2`` merge strategy:

``programmes``
    One row per Förderprogramm per *version*, holding the raw export fields --
    values before :func:`fdb_scraper.process.decode` touches them, classifier
    hrefs intact. Raw on purpose: a parse bug found next month can be re-run
    against the exact input it applied to, which a table of decoded values cannot
    support. This is the export retention the README lists as planned.

``documents``
    The linked-document index :func:`fdb_scraper.links.resolve` builds, one row
    per document. Needed alongside the raw programmes because
    :func:`fdb_scraper.process.process` reads both -- storing only the programmes
    would make the retention claim half true.

Both resources are full extracts, so no ``merge_key`` is set: dlt then treats a
record absent from a load as deleted and closes its validity window. That is how
``on_website_to`` comes to mean "the run in which the programme left the export",
with no delete detection of our own.

A third table is written here but is not part of that arrangement:

``keyword_segments``
    One row per distinct ``keywords`` string, holding the keywords a model read out
    of it (services/keyword_segmenter). Content-addressed on ``md5(keywords)`` and
    merged rather than scd2'd, because a segmentation is a function of the string
    and not a state upstream reports -- there is no version of it to keep. It is
    written here, and not in the publish step, for the reason the raw export is
    stored at all: model inference is not bit-reproducible, so the published column
    has to be read from a materialised result rather than recomputed. See
    :func:`segment_keywords`.

``id_hash`` is minted before the load, by the same
:func:`fdb_scraper.process.add_identifiers` the published table uses. Not because
dlt needs it -- scd2 matches versions by row hash -- but because
:func:`snapshot` groups a programme's versions by it to derive first-seen, last
changed and whether it is still there.
