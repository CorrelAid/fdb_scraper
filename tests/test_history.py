"""What the history looks like as programmes change, vanish and come back.

These run the real loader against a mutated copy of the export fixture, one load
per generation, so what is asserted is dlt's scd2 behaviour on our data rather
than a model of it. The claims that matter are the published ones: a programme
that changed keeps its original first-seen date, one that left the export keeps
its last known content, and one that came back stops being absent without losing
the record that it was.

:func:`fdb_scraper.history.fold` is tested separately and without a database --
it is pure, and the edge cases are cheaper to state as a frame than as four
generations of files.
