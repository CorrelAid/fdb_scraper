"""What is said about one published column, in the two places a consumer looks.

The CSVW table schema and the minted vocabulary describe the same columns from
different angles -- a cell to parse versus a property to dereference -- so what is
said about a column is decided here once and both builders read it. A note that
existed twice would drift.

Two distinctions this module keeps straight:

*datatype versus range*
    :func:`datatype_of` types the *cell* a validator parses; :func:`range_of`
    types one *value* of the property. They differ exactly on the list columns,
    whose cell is one JSON array and whose values are its members.

*generated versus written*
    Multiplicity, patterns and vocabulary sizes are read off the pandera schema,
    so they cannot contradict what the pipeline enforces. Meaning and inference
    notes are hand-written and therefore declared in
    :mod:`fdb_scraper.config`; this module only decides which of them apply to which
    column.
