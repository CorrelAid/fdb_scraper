"""The published table's contract: what it contains, and what is checked.

What is *decided* -- which fields are dropped, what they are renamed to, which
taxonomies are collapsed, what a value has to look like -- is declared in
:mod:`fdb_scraper.config` and read from there. This file turns those decisions into
a checkable schema, in reading order:

* :data:`USEABLE_FIELDS` -- what the parser is asked for, per
  :data:`~fdb_scraper.config.DROPPED_FIELDS`.
* :data:`COLUMNS` -- dtype, nullability, uniqueness and value checks per column.
* :data:`PUBLISHED_FIELDS` -- the output, in order.
* :data:`ORIGIN` -- upstream, derived or inferred, per column. The one thing a
  consumer cannot read off the values themselves.

:func:`describe` renders all of that as a table, which is usually the faster way
to answer a question about the output than reading this file.

:mod:`fdb_scraper.process` applies these declarations; it holds no declarations of
its own, so the two never disagree. Import direction is process -> schema -> config.
